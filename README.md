Users can input bulk food donations (e.g., “2 dozen eggs”, “5 kg carrots”) using an intuitive interface.

**Live Inventory Updates:**
Each ingredient's quantity can be updated, with the UI reflecting changes instantly.

**Create Recipes**
Users are able to input recipes, and the UI displays information on the current available inventory with respect to the required recipe ingredients.
